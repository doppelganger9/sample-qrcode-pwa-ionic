# Ionic PWA QR Code Scanner sample
[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fdoppelganger9%2Fsample-qrcode-pwa-ionic.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fdoppelganger9%2Fsample-qrcode-pwa-ionic?ref=badge_shield)


## Purpose

This sample should demonstrate:

- how to use cordova-plugin-qrscanner as a browser library only.
- how to hack your way to make everything transparent for the video preview to show through.

And as a bonus:

- using an NgModule to package the QRScanner Page in a module.

## Installation & Testing

- clone/fork this,
- `$ npm i`,
- `$ $(npm bin)/ionic serve` (I don't like global installs for CLIs),
- open up Chrome and try it. It should almost(*) work,
- open up your device and go to the External URL or use [Ionic DevApp](https://ionicframework.com/docs/pro/devapp/).

*(\*): "almost" because I was only able to get the scanned QR one time during all my testing...*
